# Contents of the `processed` folder

This folder contains processed data and documentation related to the aggregation and evaluation of model quantization studies. Its structure is as follows:

- **evidence-diagrams-mapping.md**: Markdown file mapping systematic studies (S1–S21) to their corresponding evidence diagrams.
- **metadata-template.json**: Template JSON file for metadata associated with processed studies.
- **model-quantization-final-selection.csv**: CSV file listing the final selection of studies included in the aggregation.
- **systematic-studies-quality-evaluation.md**: General quality evaluation questionnaire template for experimental studies, used as a basis for individual study assessments.

Subfolders for each included study (e.g., `alizadehLanguageModelsSoftware2025/`, `geensEnergyCostModelling2024/`, etc.) contain:

- **systematic-studies-quality-evaluation.md**: Study-specific responses to the quality evaluation questionnaire, including direct quotes and assessments for each criterion.
- **metadata.json**: Metadata for the study, such as the evaluated quantization precisions or the models used.
- **effects.json**: JSON file summarizing the effects measured in the study.
- **improvement_metrics.parquet**: Parquet file containing the relative improvement metrics observed with quantization in the study.
- **improvement_statistics_by_configuration.parquet** / **improvement_statistics_by_precision.parquet**: Parquet files containing descriptive statistics of the relative improvements (number of observations, mean, 95% confidence interval, and belief) from **improvement_metrics.parquet**, aggregated by configuration or by quantization method and precision configuration.

Each subfolder is named after the corresponding study and year, and contains all processed data and documentation relevant to that study.
